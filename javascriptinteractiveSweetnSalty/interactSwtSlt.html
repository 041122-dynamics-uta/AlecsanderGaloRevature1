 <h1>Welcome to Sweet'nSalty interactive!</h1>
    <p>In this game, you define the range and I will print all numbers in that range with a few extra conditions: Multiples of 3 return 'Sweet', multiples of 5 return 'Salty', and multiples of both return 'Sweet'nSalty', each instead of their resepctive number.</p>

<h3>So first, please input the start number of the your desired range</h2>
<form>
    <label>First Number</label>
    <input type="number" placeholder="First number goes here" id="firstnum">
    <button type="button" id="btn1" onclick="buttonFunc()">Submit</button>
</form>

<!-- 
1: create folder: html, js --css styling must be internal--
2: link js to html
3: begin with instructions text and then choice input box and enter
Step 7 really should go here, INPUT VALIDATION
Each choice input should print one at a time
4: “please press enter to display your results” line
5: as user progresses, alter/delete/add elements strictly thru JS DOM manipulation
6: PLAN AHEAD for styling; set class/id attributes for respective css style rules 
Apply classes dynamically using DOM manipulation;
Class/id names will be used in the <head> section to add styles to specified class/id
7: The start and stop numbers must be validated to be at least 200 apart and no more than 10,000 apart
Start number < end number
non-negative
INPUT VALIDATION FOR JS
Errors caught will 1. display explanation in red text 2. present the step again
8: run swtnslty code except with 40 per line and user determined start and end numbers
Instead of printing to console, results should appear as html content on webpage
9: swts and slts should be in a class that prints them green
